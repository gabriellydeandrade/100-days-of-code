# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Add more features in a template that I am working on in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end) 
2. Finish "Basic HTML and HTML5" in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  

**Thoughts:** After some personal problems, I'm ashamed to start this challenge for the second time. It has been a challenge for me don't miss a day, but I will struggle to improve my knowledge in this area. 
Talking about what I learned: It was fantastic remember the basic concepts in little pieces of challenges. I could remember things like: Adding the version of the html page with the Doctype tag; Always use the alt attribute inside img tag; Be careful with the divisions of your website.

### Day 2: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Correcting the position of elements in a template that I am working on in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end). I learned more about float and clear with some exercises.

**Thoughts:** WoW It's pretty hard to understand everyhing about position at the beginning. I have tried manipulate elements in this way in the past but was terrible, now I fell a little more confortable to work with the float CSS property.

### Day 3: November 16, 2018

2. Add more updates in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end) project: correcting position navigation and fixing menu and footer with position=fixed.

### Day 4: November 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I finally finished the basic of HTML and CSS project in alura. [All my code is on my github](https://github.com/gaby-andrade/front-journey). 
2. I started a new course at [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end) focused in good practices and advanced topics related to HTML5 and CSS3. 
3. I learned today: 
- CSS Units: rem, em and ch

**Thoughts:** I have some problems to merge everything into master and deleting the other branch (I'm trying to do everything in the console without interface). Besides that, I am proud of myself because I finish the first course of a front-end carrer. At the same time, I fell a little guilty because when I finish my english course I stop practing and nowadays I have some difficulties with the spelling of some words :( So...Let's learn more and more!! Step by step!
