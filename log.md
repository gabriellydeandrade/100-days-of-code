# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Add more features in a template that I am working on in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end) 
2. Finish "Basic HTML and HTML5" in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  

**Thoughts:** After some personal problems, I'm ashamed to start this challenge for the second time. It has been a challenge for me don't miss a day, but I will struggle to improve my knowledge in this area. 
Talking about what I learned: It was fantastic remember the basic concepts in little pieces of challenges. I could remember things like: Adding the version of the html page with the Doctype tag; Always use the alt attribute inside img tag; Be careful with the divisions of your website.

### Day 2: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Correcting the position of elements in a template that I am working on in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end). I learned more about float and clear with some exercises.

**Thoughts:** WoW It's pretty hard to understand everyhing about position at the beginning. I have tried manipulate elements in this way in the past but was terrible, now I fell a little more confortable to work with the float CSS property.
