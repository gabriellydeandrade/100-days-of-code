### Day 2: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Correcting the position of elements in a template that I am working on in [Alura](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-front-end). I learned more about float and clear with some exercises.

**Thoughts:** WoW It's pretty hard to understand everyhing about position at the beginning. I have tried manipulate elements in this way in the past but was terrible, now I fell a little more confortable to work with the float CSS property.
